        <p>HOW TO COOK:</p></span><span id="more">
        <ol>
        <li>First, get your counter and strawberries ready.

            After cleaning your counter, dust it with cornstarch or Mochiko flour. I spread cornstarch on the parchment paper after laying it down.
            
            
            Additionally, dust a dish or container with cornstarch or Mochiko flour.
            
            Strawberries should be cleaned and patted dry. Before using them for mochi, make sure they are completely dry.
            </li>

        <li>Measure out the Mochiko flour and sugar and mix in a medium size bowl.</li><br>
        <li>Add the water, vinegar, and food coloring to the rice flour.</li><br>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a microwaveable plate.

            Place the mochi mixture in the microwave and cook on a high setting for a minute. Not all microwaves have the same strength, so your cook time might be less or more. Please adjust accordingly. I have a powerful microwave.</li><br>
        <li>Remove from the oven and mix. Put the plastic cover back on and cook for one more minute.

            Continue doing this until it has cooked for approximately four minutes.
            
            
            The mochi will begin to bake on the bowl's sides, as you can see. The whole mixture will bake as you proceed. It's okay if, after 4 minutes, everything is cooked except for the center. It’s done.
            </li>

            <ol>
                <li>Add 1 cup of water to a box of jelly. Transfer to a pan and chill till firmly set. Atleast 4 hours or preferably overnight. I poured some jelly syrup on the greased cake pan to give that cool jelly flavor on top and chilled it.</li><br>
                <li>Cut them into shapes of your choice after it is set.
                    Add gelatin to 1/2 cup of water.
                    In a pan, bring the milk, cream and condensed milk to a boil on low heat. Switch off the flame.</li><br>
                <li>Stir in the gelatin to the cream mixture and allow it to cool. Just when is mildly lukewarm add in the cut jelly pieces. The jelly dissolves if you add it to warm milk. Just to give that marble finish I have added it just when very very mildly warm. If you aren't sure, just completely cool it. Transfer this to the pan with the set jelly and carefully position the cut jellies with a spoon and chill overnight.</li><br>
                <li>Serve your delicious jelly pudding chilled</li><br></ol></span></p>

    <p>HOW TO COOK:</p></span><span id="more">
    <ol>
        <li>To make the cake: Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C. Grease a 9×13-inch pan or line with parchment paper, leaving enough overhang on the sides for lifting the cake out of the pan after baking. Set aside.</li><br>
        <li>In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li><br>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine butter and milk over medium heat just until butter is melted. Do not let it boil. Set aside.</li><br>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or using a hand mixer, whisk eggs on high speed until combined and starting to foam, about 1 minute. Gradually add sugar and keep whisking until tripled in volume, about 5 minutes. Beat in vanilla.</li><br>
        <li>Reduce speed to medium-low and add warm milk mixture into the egg mixture in a slow, steady stream. Add flour mixture gradually and whisk just until combined.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into prepared cake pan. Bake for 25-35 minutes until the cake springs back when slightly touched and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow cake to cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes, then run a knife around the edges. Invert the pan onto the rack, lift it off and let the cake continue to cool on the rack.
        </li><br>
        <li>To make the syrup: stir together hot coffee and sugar until sugar is dissolved, then add liqueur, if using. Allow to cool.</li><br>
        <li>While the cake is till warm, poke lots of holes in the cake with a fork or toothpick. Brush with coffee syrup or pour the syrup over the cake slowly and gradually, allowing it to soak in. Use all the syrup.</li><br>
        <li>To make the frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk mascarpone, sugar, and liqueur, if using, on medium speed until combined. Add heavy cream gradually, then increase the speed to high and whisk until stiff peaks form and frosting is thick. Use immediately to frost cake. Just before serving, dust frosting lightly with cocoa powder.</li><br>
        <li>Keep cake in the fridge for up to 4 days.</li><br></ol></span></p>
